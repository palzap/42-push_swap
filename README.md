push_swap  
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.  
To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

Notes:  
My push_swap is done using only arrays.  
I did not use linked list.  
The algorithm I used was explained to me by Alex Mitcul (https://github.com/AlexMitcul), thanks a lot to him!
